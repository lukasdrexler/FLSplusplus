# FLS++

For using the Code referenced in the original paper **Local search k-means++ with Foresight**, simply create a new virtual environment and import the package *sklearn*.
Make sure to select version 1.0 of *sklearn*, since on newer versions the code does not run correctly.

After downloading the package, find the file *_kmeans.py* inside the files from the package *sklearn*. The file should be located
in the subdirectory *cluster*. Replace the *_kmeans.py* in this directory with the version from this github-repository.

As an example for running the used algorithms, you can use the exemplary *main.py* in this github repository, as well as the datasets provided in the directories
*datasets* and *datasets_large*.
